============
Opener Rebid
============

.. ag is stricter about points: min: 13-16, invit: 17-18


Minimum (13-15/16p)
===================

- After limit raise, try to go to game (`1S-3S`, if balanced :shape:`5-4-4-3` and <15p, `p`; else, `4S`)

- `1NT` rebid promises balanced min, but doesn't guarantee stoppers


Invitational (16/17-18p)
========================

- `1M-2M-2NT`: asks partner to choose 3M/4M if at low/high end of limit

- `1M-2M-?s`: long suit game try: 4M if max (9/10p) or Q/K/A/void/double in this; else, 3M

- `1M-2M-3M`: w/6+ in suit

- Can `"reverse"` w/17+hcp


some play 1M-2M-3M as preemptive?

GF (18/19+p)
============

- Reverse
- `1D-2S-4S` (not a signoff; partner could investigate slam if good)
- `1D-1H-2S` (game forcing jump shift, 19-21hcp)
- `1D-1H-2NT`: balanced 18-19hcp (not Jacoby 2NT; only for responder)



With :hand:`KQ3 52 AJ864 QJ9`, would we rebid 2H or 1NT? (only 4-3 fit,
a vote for 1NT) (worthless doubleton, a vote for 2H)

:hand:`AKxx xx Jx AQJxx`, `1D-3D-3S`: 16p+11p is game, but 3NT or 5D?
doesn't suggest spades as the trump, but shows strength in that suit
(since i didn't mention hearts, they can use our weakness here to figure out)
(if they take us to 3NT and we big again, this would be a slam try)
(if this took us to 4-level, like in clubs, would be slam try since we're past 3NT)

:hand:`AQ Qxxxx AJT KQx`, `1H-2H-3NT` ( have 8 card fit, but the hearts are poor,
and the hand is semi-balanced; might be easier to make 8 in NT)

:hand:`Ax AKxxxx AKTx x`, `1H-2H-3C` -- this looks like LGHT, but if they
refuse and go to 3H, we bid game. This can show partner that we didn't need help
from them, and suggests we investigate slam.  (would -3S be the same, since moves us past 3H? --
prob not, that would be control-bidding spades to show void/Ace)
