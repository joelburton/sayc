Opener Rebid
============

Min (13-15/16p)
---------------

- After limit raise, try to go to game (``1S-3S``, if balanced 5443 and <15p, pass; else, game)
- ``1NT`` rebid promises balanced min, but doesn't guarantee stoppers

Invitational (16/17-18p)
------------------------

- ``1M-2M-2NT``: asks partner to choose 3M/4M if at low/high end of limit
- ``1M-2M-\*s``: long suit game try: 4M if max (9/10p) or Q/K/A/void/double in this; else, 3M
- ``1M-2M-3M``: w/6+ in suit
- w/17+hcp: can reverse

GF (18/19+p)
------------

- Reverse
- ``1D-2S-4S`` (not a signoff; partner could investigate slam if good)
- ``1D-1H-2S`` (game forcing jump shift, 19-21hcp)
- ``1D-1H-2NT``: balanced 18-19hcp
