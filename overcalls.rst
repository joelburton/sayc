Overcalls
=========


.. note:: link to takeout double (remember, that makes you dummy, so eval as such)


.. note:: vuln should definition be here wrt "exceptional quality" and count judgement w/dummy points

.. note:: with two 5c suits, open higher, like opening

.. note:: ag: ~7-17 (less hcp should mean better suit)

.. note:: good thing to think about for on-the-cusp evals: do i want this lead?

- 1-level: 8-16+hcp & decent 5+c (ok: 4c of exceptional quality)

- 2-level: 10-16+hcp & better-than-just-decent 5+c (looser req w/6c)

- Direct 1NT overall: balanced, 15-18hcp & (usually?) stopper

  - SAYC says Stayman is on, but not transfers (many play all systems on)

    TODO be careful, though: if you have as many points as RHO, they can play through you

.. note:: rule of 500 for preemptive jump overcalls - can afford 3 down if non-vuln, 2 if vuln

- Jump overcalls are preemptive, and like weak openings

  NOTE ag: prefer longer 5c suit, nto stronger:

  QTxxx Kx AKJxx 8, opp opens 1D, overcall 1S, not 1C

  can intro the clubs later

Responding to overcall: 1C-(1H)-p

- Raise is simple competitive 6-10/11p 4+t
- Jump raise: 6-10p and 4+t and now preemptive
- Raise to game is to play
- New suit show lack of fit and are forcing by unpassed hand
- Limit+ raise with cue bid: `1C-(1H)-p-(2C)`
- `2NT` is natural, not Jacoby 2NT
- Negative double
- Pass if strong in opp suit or has no good bid (since partner can bid again)

Jump overcalls are preemptive & same shape as preempts

.. note::

  :hand:`AJxxx x xxxx xxx` `1S-(2H)-4S`


Responding to Overcall
======================

XXX Overcall preempts (not with preempts), since partner will have some points.

  Cuebid shows a strong (HOW STRONG?) two-suited hand.

  here:  :hand:`AQJ75 AKJ96 72 4` over 3D opening, a cuebid shows 2-suited (often,
  majors, since opp has D)

`1C-(1H)-2H` cuebid shows limit raise (a direct jump raise would be preemptive);
  this could be greater than limit

`1D-(1H)-X`: shows exactly 4 |s| (if there were 5, would overcall |s|)

Bidding NT promises stopper in overcall suit


Michaels Direct Cuebid: `1H-(2H)`
=================================

Direct cuebid when opponents have bid only one suit (not alerted; is "standard")

- If cue is minor, shows 5-5 or better in H+S
- If major, shows 5-5 of better in other M and a minor
- Cuebidding major may force to level-3, so should be a bit stronger
- No required point range; look at value of those 5-5 (9hcp may be fine)
- Mini-maxi: weak or strong; with middle, overcall and try to intro other suit *(not SAYC)*
- Can make with `1D-1NT-(2D)` â€” they've only bid one suit; also can make over preempt
- Cuebid in balancing seat is Michaels: `1C-p-p-(2C)`

Responses to Michaels
---------------------

- Preference bid
- Jump preference (preemptive)
- Cuebid of opener suit, game or slam
- New suit, NF
- `2NT`; if cue is major, asks partner to name minor
- `3NT` to play
- `4C` same as 2NT if 2NT not avail; same with 4NT

Unusual Notrump: `1H-(2NT)`
===========================

Direct jump to 2NT, showing lower-ranking two unbid. Can also be mini-maxi, like Michaels.

- Not alerted
- `2C-(2NT)` is Unusual (`2C` is artificial), but not `2DHS-(2NT)`, that's just strong `2NT` overcall
- In balance seat, `2NT` isn't Unusual, just strong 19-21hcp, like `1D-(p)-p-(2NT)`

Responses to Unusual Notrump
----------------------------

Same as Michaels (except for `2NT` and `4C`)

Overcalling 1NT: Cappelletti
============================

SAYC doesn't include any 1NT defense; some use this, others Landy or DONT.

Should be <15hcp; if more, double. Can be used in balancing seat. Bids:

- Double  = equivalent hand (was going to open 1NT)
- `2C*` = 1-suit, ~6+c (some play with 5c)
- `2D*` = 5 |h| & 5 |s| (some play w/4-4)
- `2H*` = |h| & a minor
- `2S*` = |s| & a minor
- `2NT*` = both minor
- 3-anything natural

Responses to Cappelletti
------------------------

- Double: keep in if strong; else move to suit
- Can pass `2C*` or `2D*` with 6+ good |c|/|d|
- `2C*-2D*` asks suit, `2HS` w/good 5c, `2NT` is 11+hcp and ok w/any
- `2D*`: `2HS` picks, `2NT*` asks better minor, `3C` is 6+c C, `3HS` invite game w/4+ in suit
- `2HS*`: pass to play, raise 7-10p, new suit natural NF, `2NT*` asks for minor
