Overcalls
=========

.. link to takeout double (remember, that makes you dummy, so eval as such)


.. vuln should definition be here wrt "exceptional quality" and count judgement w/dummy points

.. with two 5c suits, open higher, like opening
`
.. ag: ~7-17 (less hcp should mean better suit)

- 1-level: 8-16+hcp & decent 5+c (ok: 4c of exceptional quality)

- 2-level: 10-16+hcp & better-than-just-decent 5+c (looser req w/6c)

- Direct 1NT overall: balanced, 15-18hcp & (usually?) stopper

  - SAYC says Stayman is on, but not transfers (many play all systems on)

- Jump overcalls are preemptive, and like weak openings

Responding to overcall: 1C-(1H)-p

- Raise is simple competitive 6-10/11p 4+t
- Jump raise: 6-10p and 4+t and preemptive
- Raise to game is to play
- New suit show lack of fit and are forcing by unpassed hand
- Limit raise with cue bid: 1C-(1H)-p-(2C)

Jump overcalls are preemptive & same shape as preempts

Michaels Direct Cuebid: ``1H-(2H)``
-----------------------------------

Direct cuebid when opponents have bid only one suit (not alerted; is "standard")

- If cue is minor, shows 5-5 or better in H+S
- If major, shows 5-5 of better in other M and a minor
- Cuebidding major may force to level-3, so should be a bit stronger
- No required point range; look at value of those 5-5 (9hcp may be fine)
- Mini-maxi: weak or strong; with middle, overcall and try to intro other suit *(not SAYC)*
- Can make with ``1D-1NT-(2D)`` â€” they've only bid one suit; also can make over preempt
- Cuebid in balancing seat is Michaels: ``1C-p-p-(2C)``

Responses to Michaels
+++++++++++++++++++++

- Preference bid
- Jump preference (preemptive)
- Cuebid of opener suit, game or slam
- New suit, NF
- ``2NT``; if cue is major, asks partner to name minor
- ``3NT`` to play
- ``4C`` same as 2NT if 2NT not avail; same with 4NT

Unusual Notrump: ``1H-(2NT)``
-----------------------------

Direct jump to 2NT, showing lower-ranking two unbid. Can also be mini-maxi, like Michaels.

- Not alerted
- ``2C-(2NT)`` is Unusual (``2C`` is artificial), but not ``2D/H/S-(2NT)``, that's just strong ``2NT`` overcall
- In balance seat, ``2NT`` isn't Unusual, just strong 19-21hcp, like ``1D-(p)-p-(2NT)``

Responses to Unusual Notrump
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Same as Michaels (except for ``2NT`` and ``4C``)

Overcalling 1NT: Cappelletti
----------------------------

SAYC doesn't include any 1NT defense; some use this, others Landy or DONT.

Should be <15hcp; if more, double. Can be used in balancing seat. Bids:

- Double  = equivalent hand (was going to open 1NT)
- ``2C*`` = 1-suit, ~6+c (some play with 5c)
- ``2D*`` = 5 |h| & 5 |s| (some play w/4-4)
- ``2H*`` = |h| & a minor
- ``2S*`` = |s| & a minor
- ``2NT*`` = both minor
- 3-anything natural

Responses to Cappelletti
++++++++++++++++++++++++

- Double: keep in if strong; else move to suit
- Can pass ``2C*`` or ``2D*`` with 6+ good |c|/|d|
- ``2C*-2D*`` asks suit, ``2H/S`` w/good 5c, ``2NT`` is 11+hcp and ok w/any
- ``2D*``: ``2H/S`` picks, ``2NT*`` asks better minor, ``3C`` is 6+c C, ``3H/S`` invite game w/4+ in suit
- ``2H/S*``: pass to play, raise 7-10p, new suit natural NF, ``2NT*`` asks for minor
