Responding to 1M
================

Support pts, only after a fit, clear length points — V/S/D: 3t: 3p/2p/1p, 4+t: 5p/3p/1p

- Don't count "non-working honors" (ie, singleton Q gets support but not value)

Min responses (6-9/10p)
-----------------------

- 5+t: preemptive to 4-level: ``1H-4H``

- Raise partner major if 3+t: ``1H-2H``

- New suit of 4+c at 1 level (up line w/4, down with 5): ``1C-2D`` or ``1C-2S``

- Else: 1NT

.. sidebar::

  Some sources, like Seagram's *Bidding at Bridge*, require 4+t to invite directly.

Invitational (10/11-12p)
------------------------

- Raise partner major to 3-level if 3+t: 1H-3H

- New suit of 4+c (w/4-4: cheapest avail; w/5-5 down-the-line)

  - New suit at 2-level shows 5+c if 10hcp, 11+hcp can show 4c

- 10hcp: 1NT, 11-12hcp: 2NT

GF (13+p)
---------

- With 5+t and weak: directly to 4 level: 1H-4H

- New suit of 4+ (forcing) (rather than supporting directly, which denies strength)

GF (13+p) and 4 of major: Jacoby 2NT: 1H/S-2NT* openers rebid
-------------------------------------------------------------

- w/balanced minimum (<=14hcp), no singleton, void, or 2nd 5c+ suit: game*

- w/15-17hcp w/no singleton/void/2nd 5c suit: ``3NT•``, slam interest (opener prob is 5422)

- w/18+hcp: ``rebid major at 3 level•``, definite slam interest

- w/singleton or void: ``3-level in side suit•``

- w/2nd 5c suit: ``4-level in suit•`` (with 2nd 5c suit, has void/singleton; pick better feature)

Slam zone (19+p): jump shift: ``1S-3C``, followed by supporting spades if can
