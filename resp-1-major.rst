.. compound::

  **Levels**:

  - Minimum: 6-9/10p

  - Invitational: 10/11-12p

  - Game-force: 13-18p

  - Slam invite: 19+p


Minimum
=======

- 5+t: preemptive to 4-level: `1H-4H`

- Raise partner major if 3+t: `1H-2H`

- New suit of 4+c at 1 level (up line w/4, down with 5): `1C-2D` or `1C-2S`

- Else: `1NT` (for 6-10p)


Invitational
============

- Raise partner major to 3-level if 3+t: 1H-3H

  .. bridge baron: this is "limit major raise"

- New suit of 4+c (w/4-4, cheapest avail; w/5-5, down-the-line)

  - SAYC book: new suit at 2-level shows 5+c if 10hcp, 11+hcp can show 4c

  - Others: can show 4c, except `2H`, which shows 5+c

    - Rationale: opener could have bid `1S` if they had 4 |s|

- 10hcp: `1NT`, 11-12hcp: `2NT`


.. topic:: Inviting with only 3 trumps

  Some sources, like Seagram's *Bidding at Bridge*, require 4+t to invite directly.
  Without 4t, you first bid another non-reverse suit or NT, and then can
  show delayed 3t support.


Game force
==========

- With 5+t and weak: directly to 4 level: `1H-4H`

- New suit of 4+ (forcing) (rather than supporting directly, which denies strength)


.. _jacoby-2nt:

4 of major GF: Jacoby 2NT
-------------------------

Example: `1HS-2NT*`. Openers rebids are:

- Balanced minimum (<=14hcp), no singleton, void, or 2nd 5c+ suit: `"game"*`

- 15-17hcp w/no singleton/void/2nd 5c suit: `3NT*`, slam interest

  - Opener prob is :shape:`5-4-2-2`, or they would have opened `1NT`

- 18+hcp: `"rebid major at 3 level"*`, definite slam interest

- Singleton or void: `"3-level in side suit"*`

- 2nd 5c suit: `"4-level in suit"*`

  - With 2nd 5c suit, has void/singleton; pick better feature


Slam zone
=========

- Jump shift: `1S-3C`, followed by supporting spades if can
