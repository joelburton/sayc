Leads and Carding
=================

Lead v Notrump
--------------

- Lead partners suit

  - doubleton: highest of any

  - xxx: author says low, SAYC says top-of-nothing

  - Touching honors: lead top: (J)T7 _are_

  -  Hxx: low or 4th best

- Own suit

  - KQJx (3 touching) top of seq (but not A from AKQ; see below)

  - KQTxx (broken w/top two touching) still top of seq

  - AJTx (broken interior) top of interior seq

  - Hxxx: 4th best

  - Akxxx: STILL 4th best

  - Passive nothing lead: top-of-nothing (4th best only from 5)

- Ace

  - Special meaning: partner, play an honor (if none, give count). From semi-solid suit.



Lead v Suit
-----------

- Lead partner's suit: similar to NT

  - ??: highest

  - Hxx: low or 4th best

  - JTx touching: top (J)

  - xxx or more: low or 4th best

  - If you supported suit: lead high from 3, so partner knows you don't have doubleton

- Own suit

  - KQJ7: top of seq

  - KQxx:  top of seq

  - KJTx: top of inner seq (J) - but avoid leading from tenace

- Ace

  - DO NOT underlead ace

  - AVOID leading ace unless there's no better choice

- Ace/King

  - Ace is std in SAYC but lots of people use K

- Leading short suit

  - Singletons can be good (but if your trumps are natural winners, don't)

  - If you have lots of trumps, you want to shorter opponent's trumps - lead long

  - If partner is known to be weak, you won't get ruff

  - Doubletons are usually bad; you won't get the ruff you want

- Trumps

  - Good to avoid crossruff (e.g., they bid 3 suits until fit)

  - We opened 1NT; reduce their trumps to let your winners win

  - We have long suit and they have 4-4

  - Or: everything else is worse

  - Low from spots or top of touching honor


Signals
-------

- Attitude before Count before Suit Pref (only if known or irrelevant proceed to next)

- Attitude: high is good

- Count: hi-low is even, going up is odd

- Attitude: low asks lead of lowest non-trump, high is highest non-trump
