Responding to 1m
================

.. topic:: How many |c|\ /\ |d| will opener usually have?

  - `1C`: 3=16%, 4=38%, 5=29%, 6+=17%

  - `1D`: 3=4%, 4=43%, 5=34%, 6+=19%

.. important::

  Don't add support points: might end up in NT.


Minimum (6-9/10p)
=================

- New suit 4+c at 1-level (up the line w/4c, down w/5c, prefer M to m): `1C-1D`

  - Rationale to prefer M to m: opponents are likely to enter auction; you may not get a 2-level bid before finding a fit

- Raise minor w/support (5+c for `1C` or 4+c for `1D`) but no 4+c major

- Else: `1NT` (does not promise balanced)


Invitational (10/11-12p)
========================

- New suit as 1-or-2 level, as above (remember: new suit by unpassed responder is forcing)

- Jump raise minor w/support (4+c) (but game is probably going to be in 3NT): `1C-3C`

- Exactly 10hcp and no 4+c M: `1NT` (does not promise balanced)

- 11-12hcp and no 4+c M: `2NT`

.. topic:: "Classic" vs "Modern" NT responses

  The "classic" responses to 1m for NT are:

  - 13-15hcp no 4+c M: `2NT`

  - 16-17hcp no 4+c M: `3NT`

  However, the lowered amounts shown are more common & better.

  .. in bridge baron, this is "1m-2NT Invitational"


GF (13+p)
=========

- 13-15hcp and no 4+c: `3NT`

- New suit as 1-or-2 level, as above (remember: new suit by unpassed responder is forcing)

- Jump raise minor w/support (4+c) (but game is probably going to be in 3NT): `1C-3C`


Slam zone (19+p)
================

- Jump shift (should have 5+c)



Alternative approaches
======================

.. rubric:: Inverted minor raises

An alternative approach is "inverted minor raises", swapping 2-level an 3-level responses. I don't use this.
