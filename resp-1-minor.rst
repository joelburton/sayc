Responding to 1m
================

.. TODO dont forget splinters can be used here

Don't add support points: might end up in NT

Min (6-9/10p)
-------------

- New suit 4+c at 1-level (up the line w/4c, down w/5c, prefer M to m): ``1C-1D``
- Raise minor w/support (5+c) but no 4+c major:

.. ag says 4c support is ok, since opener will usually have 5c

.. x "inverted minor raises" listed by ag, but not using

- Else: ``1NT`` (does not promise balanced)

Invitational (10/11-12p)
------------------------

- New suit as 1-or-2 level, as above (remember: new suit by unpassed responder is forcing)
- New suit: ``1D-2C``
- Jump raise minor w/support (4+c) (but game is prob 3NT): ``1C-3C``
- w/10hcp: ``1NT`` (does not promise balanced)

.. ag: says "modern style" is 2NT=invitational, balanced + 10-12 or 11-12p
.. 13-15hcp + balanced = 3nt
.. in bridge baron, this is "1m-2NT Invitational"

GF (13+p)
---------

- 13-15hcp no 4+c major: ``2NT``
- 16-17hcp no 4+c major: ``3NT``
- By agreement: 11-12hcp = ``2NT``, and 13-15hcp = ``3NT`` (better, but not SAYC)

Slam zone (19+p)
----------------

- Jump shift (should have 5+c)
