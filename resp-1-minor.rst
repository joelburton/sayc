Responding to 1m
================

Don't add support points: might end up in NT

Min (6-9/10p)
-------------

- New suit 4+c at 1-level (up the line w/4c, down w/5c, prefer M to m): ``1C-1D``
- Raise minor w/support (5+c) but no 4+c major: ``1C-2C``
- Else: ``1NT``

Invitational (10/11-12p)
------------------------

- New suit: ``1D-2C``
- Jump raise minor w/support (4+c) (but game is prob 3NT): ``1C-3C``
- w/10hcp: ``1NT``

GF (13+p)
---------

- 13-15hcp no 4+c major: ``2NT``
- 16-17hcp no 4+c major: ``3NT``
- By agreement: 11-12hcp = ``2NT``, and 13-15hcp = ``3NT`` (better, but not SAYC)

Slam zone (19+p)
----------------

- Jump shift (should have 5+c)
