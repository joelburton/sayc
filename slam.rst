Slam Bidding
============

RKC 0314
--------

- Don't use w/worthless doubletons or voids (too risky!)

- Don't use if you won't bid slam missing one ace.

- 5 keycards: As & trump K: C=03 D=14 H=2-no-Q S=2-yes-Q

- For C/D responses, queen ask: cheapest non-trump=No, Trump-at-6=Yes, Else=Yes+

  - Example (H trump): 4NT-5D-5H-6H (yes), -5S (no), -6C (yes, plus more)

  - Alternative: bid cheapest suit you have K in: 4NT-5D-5H-6C (have C K)

- 5NT asks for Kings with standard Blackwood 0-or-4/1/2/3

- 4C when no trump chosen : 0-or-4/1/2/3, 5C: same for kings

Interference: DOPI/ROPI
-----------------------

- Overcalled DOPI: Double w/0, pass w/1. Else: up-the-line: next avail suit=2, next=3.

- Doubled: ROPI: redouble w/0, pass w/1. Same.

- Some use DEPO for interference above 5-level: double w/even # of aces, pass w/odd.
