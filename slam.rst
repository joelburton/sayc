Slam Bidding
============

RKC 0314
========

- Don't use w/worthless doubletons or voids (too risky!)

- Don't use if you won't bid slam missing one ace.

- 5 keycards: As & trump K: |c|\ =03 |d|\ =14 |h|\ =2-no-Q |s|\ =2-yes-Q

- For |c|/|d| responses, queen ask: cheapest non-trump=No, Trump-at-6=Yes, Else=Yes+

  - Example (|h| trump): `4NT-5D-5H-6H` (yes), ``-5S`` (no), ``-6C`` (yes, plus more)

  - Alternative: bid cheapest suit you have K in: `4NT-5D-5H-6C` (have |c|\ K)

- 5NT asks for Kings with standard Blackwood 0-or-4/1/2/3


.. _gerber:

Gerber
======

- `4C` when no trump chosen : 0-or-4/1/2/3, `5C`: same for kings


Interference: DOPI/ROPI
=======================

- Overcalled DOPI: Double w/0, pass w/1. Else: up-the-line: next avail suit=2, next=3.

- Doubled: ROPI: redouble w/0, pass w/1. Same.

- Some use DEPO for interference above 5-level: double w/even # of aces, pass w/odd.


.. _4nt-quant:

====================

Are you at high end of your NT bid? 17hcp or 16hcp and a 5c suit, `6NT` or `p`.


.. _5nt-quant:

5NT quantitative ask
====================
