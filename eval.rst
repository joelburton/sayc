Distribution Points
===================

- +1 for every card beyond 4th in a suit

- -1p for singleton K/Q/J or dubious doubleton (KQ KJ QJ)

- +1p for 2+ 10s

- 1p for Ace-less hand, perhaps

- Shade up for lots of As and Ks, down for quacks


Support Points
==============

When evaluating your hand as dummy *after* a fit found:

- clear length points, add shortness V/S/D: 3t: 3p/2p/1p, 4+t: 5p/3p/1p

- Don't count "non-working honors" (ie, singleton Q gets support but not value)
