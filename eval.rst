Distribution Points
===================

.. rubric:: Positive

- +1 for every card beyond 4th in a suit

- +1p for 2+ :suit:`10`\ s

.. rubric:: Negative

- 1p for :shape:`4-3-3-3`

- -1p for singleton :suit:`K/Q/J` or dubious doubleton (:suit:`KQ` :suit:`KJ` :suit:`QJ`)

- 1p for Ace-less hand, perhaps

.. rubric:: Finer judgement

- Strength should be in longer suits

- Shade up for lots of As and Ks, down for quacks


Support Points
==============

When evaluating your hand as dummy *after* a fit found:

- Clear length points, add shortness V/S/D: 3t: 3p/2p/1p, 4+t: 5p/3p/1p

- Don't count :dfn:`non-working honors` *(ie, singleton Q gets support but not value)*
