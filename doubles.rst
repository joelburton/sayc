Doubles / Redoubles
===================

.. highlights::

   Types of doubles:

   - `Penalty Doubles`_: they can't make it, we get more points
   - `Takeout Doubles`_: pick a suit
   - `Negative Doubles`_: pick a suit (after an overcall)
   - `Lead-Directing Doubles`_: lead this suit
   - `Balancing Doubles`_: made in passout seat, keep alive & protect partner
   - `Reopening Doubles`_: made in passout seat, like a takeout by opener

Penalty Doubles
---------------

- Doubles of game = penalty (may have lead-directing msg, too)

- Double of 1NT = penalty, responses are

  - Passed: If distributional: pull if weak, jump if 8+p (invites game); else: keep

  - RHO bid: double for penalty, cuebid for takeout, bid, or pass

Takeout Doubles
---------------

- Double of natural bid below 3S when opponents have bid suit(s)

- Short in opponent suit(s), can support unbid, about an opening hand (looser if shapely)

- Also used for: too strong to overcall directly (17+hcp), 2nd bid will reveal overcall

.. rubric:: Responses:

- 5+ good cards in opponent suit & strong: can pass ("convert") (else must reply!)

- Bid longest (tied? Prefer major)
- 
  10-12hcp & 4/5c suit: jump bid suit
- 
  6-10hcp & stopper in those suit(s): ``1NT``, 11-12hcp & 2 stoppers: ``2NT``, 13-16hcp: ``3NT``
- 
  Cuebid opponent suit: "we have game in whatever; you pick"

.. rubric:: Rebids by doubler after partnered picked suit:

- Pass: 16p or less

- Raise (need 4+c in suit): 17-18p raise, 19-21p jump raise

- New suit: 17-20p (needs 5+c), strong & 6+c good suit: jump new suit

- NTs: 18-19p ``1NT``, 19-21p ``2NT`` (if non-jump, needs 21-22 if jump), 9 tricks for ``3NT``

- Cuebid: 21+p and slam

.. rubric:: Response after intervention:

- Don't have to respond (but remember TO shows opening values, so often you should)

- Cuebid if strong 12+hcp in both unbid, "partner, pick"


Opponents Make Takeout
++++++++++++++++++++++

- Redouble = 10+hcp & tend to deny fit in opener suit

- Raise = same as usual

- Jump raise = preemptive w/4c

- Jump raise to game = 5c + weak (same as usual)

- ``2NT*`` = limit raise (`Jordan`/`Truscott`) (w/minor: 5c support)

- New suit at 1-level: F

- New suit at 2-level: invitational w/5+c in bid suit

- Jump shift: preemptive

Lead-Directing Doubles
----------------------

Of artificial bid; be careful doing at low levels (like ``1NT-2C*``) unless you have some strength.

Redouble & SOS Redouble
-----------------------

- If at 4-level or higher: to play
- Of double of artificial bid: to play
- Good hand if opponent double was takeout
- SOS when doubled for penalty at 3-level or lower

Negative Doubles
----------------

- Partner opens, RHO overcalls (Takeout by responder): ``1C-(1D)-X``.
- 1-level: 6+hcp, 2-level: 8+hcp, 3-level: 10+hcp. Donâ€™t have to be short in opponent suit.
- ``1C-(1S)-X``: 4+ hearts, not necessarily diamonds
- ``1C-(1D)-X`` = 4+ in both majors; if only one, would do ``1C-(1D)-1H/S``
- Played through 2S per SAYC, but this book author uses 3S

.. rubric:: Responding to Neg Double

- Min rebid: <16p NFl
- Jump rebid: 16-18 NF
- Cue bid opponent suit: 19+p GF
- Pass (rare) penalty

Balancing Doubles
-----------------

See :doc:`balancing`.

Reopening Doubles
-----------------

- Opener overcalled, partner couldn't double (would be a negative double)

- Like a TO double by opener: ``1D-(2C)-p-(p)-X``

- Often good choice if you have singleton/doubleton in overcalled suit
