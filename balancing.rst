Balancing
=========

- Opps stop bidding at low level: In passout seat: can overbid by 3pt ("borrow a King")
- Since can overbid by 3pt, for "normal" overcalls: start with double, then do as normal
- Don't balance with strong holding in opponent suit: this might help them find a better suit

Choices

- Double: takeout or to show strength
- NT: 1NT 12-14hcp, 2NT 19-21hcp (not Unusual), Double followed by min NT: 15-18hcp
- Jump in suit: opening count (NOT weak, like in direct seat)
- Cuebid: Michaels

Responding to Balancing overcall (adjust by +3p, since balance can be light)

- NT: 1NT: 9-12p, 2NT: 12-14p, 3NT: 15+p
- Have decent control of opponent suit & tolerance for partner suit

Responding to Balancing NT (adjust by +3p): systems on
