Opening 1 of Suit
=================

Evaluating (can apply these to "hcp" for openings)

- -1p for singleton K/Q/J or dubious doubleton (KQ KJ QJ)
- +1p for 2+ 10s
- Shade up for lots of As and Ks, down for quacks

Opening

- 1st/2nd seat: 13p or Rule of 20: hcp & length of two longest suits
- 3rd seat light: 10-11hcp if suit is strong (even w/4c in M if very strong like AKQx)
- 4th seat: Rule of 15 ("Cansino Count"): hcp + # of Spades
- Bid highest ok suit (5M or highest minor); ?=?=3=3 C,  ?=?=4=4 D
- 4-4 in minors and 17hcp can bid up line (reverse is ok)
