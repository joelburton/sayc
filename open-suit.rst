Opening 1 of Suit

Evaluating suit opening
=======================

Apply :ref:`dist-points`.

- **1st/2nd seat**: 13p or Rule of 20: hcp & length of two longest suits

- **3rd seat light**: 10-11hcp if suit is strong (even w/4c in M if very strong like :suit:`AKQx`)

- **4th seat:** Rule of 15 (*Cansino Count*): hcp + # of Spades


Choosing suit
=============

- Bid highest suit (5M or highest minor); :shape:`?=?=3=3` |c|,  :shape:`?=?=4=4` |d|

- 6/5 minor/major:

  - If weak: bid 5c major, since you may not get another bid

  - If stronger: bid 6c minor, can bind major twice to show its length

- 4-4 in minors and 17hcp can bid up line (reverse is ok)
