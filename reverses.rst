.. sidebar:: Is ``1H-2C-2S`` a reverse?

  Most say yes, but probably ok w/15+p, since partner showed 10+p

Non-jump rebid at 2-level in new suit higher than 1st, 17+p, usually 5+/4+ in 1st/2nd. Forcing.

Responding to reverse
---------------------

Responding to reverse w/min:

- Simple preference to opener's major (many play as single-round-force, see Ingberman)
- Rebid 5c major
- w/o major, Ingberman 2NT*: opener, bid 1st suit ("Lebensohl after Opener's Reverse")

Responding to reverse w/more than min:

- 8+hcp, GF
- ``1C-1NT-2D-2H/S``: GF, stopper in bid major
- ``1D-1NT-2H-3NT``: to play
- ``1C-1S-2D-3S``: GF 6+ |s|
- ``1D-1S-2H-4D``: GF/slam invite don't want 3NT (``3D`` would agree |d| and be GF)
- ``1C-1D-2D-2H*``: 4th suit, asking partner to bid NT w/|h| stopper
