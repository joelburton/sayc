===================
Rebids by Responder
===================

- Weak: Pass, 1NT, or min-level rebid of previously-mentioned suit

- Invitational: 2NT, jump-rebid in original or opener's 2nd suit to 3-level

- Forcing: new suit by unpassed responder forcing unless 1st call was 1NT

- GF: reverse (eg 1C-1H-1NT-2S), jump-shift (1C-1H-1NT-3D)

- Sign off in game: 2nd round bid in game (3NT, 4H/S, 5C/D)

- 2/1 response: NOT GF but promises another bid unless opener signs off in game


Fourth Suit Forcing
===================

Intro of only unbid suit at 2-level or higher.  `1C-1D-1H-1S` not FSF; `1C-1D-1H-2S*` is.

Opener's rebid after FSF:

- If responder's 1st suit was major, opener can now show delayed 3c support for it

- NT w/stopper in 4th suit

- Else: DSI (can raise 4th suit to show 4c in it; can rebid a 5c suit)
