  :columns: 3

  - 0-7p: pass
  - 8-9p: invitational
  - 10-15p: game
  - 16-17p: slam invite
  - 18+p: slam

Stayman ``1NT-2C``
++++++++++++++++++

- Invitational or better (but not for 4333 hands; will make as many tricks in NT)
- `Garbage Stayman`: for weak hands like 4=4=4=1; pass whatever they say
- `Pretend Stayman`: 5+ GF in minor - ``1NT-2D/H/S-3m`` (don't need to have 4 in a major)
- For 5c-4c, use Stayman & if they answer w/4, transfer to 5

Jacoby transfers ``1NT-2D/H/S``
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

.. sidebar:: Example ``1NT-2D``

   ``1NT-2D/H/S•`` (all w/5+c major except 5c-4c use Stayman)

- 5c major: bid ``2NT`` (invite) or ``3NT`` (game); partner converts to major with 3
- 6c major: bid ``3M`` (invite) or ``4M`` (game)
- 5c-5c M hands

  - Invitational: xfer to |h|, bid ``2S``; tells partner you have 5c-5c and to pick |h|/|s|
  - GF: xfer to |s| and bid ``4H``; partner will know you have 5c-5c and can pick H/S
  - Slam interest: xfer to |s| and rebid ``3H``

- ``1NT-2S*`` is transfer to 3C (to play); partner can correct 3D (to play)
- Jacoby Super Accept: 4c in major and max 1NT: ``1NT-2D•-3H`` (*not* ``2H``)

Texas transfers ``1NT-4D/H*``
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Use to show game values and 6c in a suit.

- ``1NT-4D*-4H-p`` if you aren't interested in slam

- ``1NT-4D*-4H-4NT`` is ace-asking

- With Texas, these change

  - ``1NT-2D*-2H-4NT``: quantitative, invites slam in either |h| (with 5c) or NT

  - ``1NT-2D*-2H-4H``: mild slam interest


Long minor: ``1NT-3m*``
+++++++++++++++++++++++

Game invite with 6+c in minor.

- Suggested but not in SAYC: requires 2 of 3 top honors

  - If opener has missing honor/Jxx/10xx/4c, they go to 3NT *(suit can be run)*

- If have 7+c and AK, just do ``1NT-3NT``, very likely can be run

Long major: ``1NT-3M``
++++++++++++++++++++++

- 6+c, interest in slam (else would just transfer)

Gerber ``1NT-4C``
+++++++++++++++++

See :ref:`gerber`.

Quant Invite ``1NT-4NT``
++++++++++++++++++++++++

See :ref:`4nt`.

- w/17hcp or 16hcp and a 5c suit, ``6NT``

Interference
------------

- ``1NT-(X)`` is still systems-on

  - Can escape to 2C/2D with redouble: ``1NT-(X)-XX-2C``

- ``1NT-(2C)-X`` is Stayman

- 3-level bids are GF: ``1NT-(2S)-3H``

- ``1NT-suit`` is systems-off and natural; ``X`` is for penalty

- Cue bid is GF and Stayman: ``1NT-(2H)-3H`` (shows 4+\ |s|)

- Stayman doubled ``1NT-(2C)-X``

  - Make normal rebid
  - Pass w/4 weak clubs
  - Redouble w/5 clubs or 4 good clubs

- Stayman overcalled

  - Bid 4c M at 2-level
  - Double for penalty (w/4c in opp suit)
  - Pass (responder then: doubles for penalty, passes, or makes normal bid)

- Transfer doubled

  - Redouble (strong holding in doubled suit: ``1NT-2H-(X)`` shows |h| strength not |s|)
  - Transfer (shows 3+t) or Transfer at 3-level (4+t and max)
  - Pass (responder then: pass/redouble to play, normal bid, or sign off in M at 2-level)

- Transfer overcalled

  - Bid ``3M`` w/good supporting hand
  - Double for penalty
  - Pass (responder then: re-transfer, normal bid, double for strength, pass)

Higher NT
---------

.. hlist::

  - 18-19hcp: 1 suit, plan jump to 2NT
  - 20-21hcp: ``2NT``
  - 22-24hcp: ``2C`` then ``2NT``
  - 25-27hcp: ``3NT`` (or Gambling)
  - 28-29hcp: ``2C`` then ``3NT``
  - 30-31hcp: ``2C`` then ``4NT``
