Evaluating Notrump
==================

**Traditional style**: use exact HCP for NT evaluation.

**Modern style**: Not always exactly HCP; can use judgement.

- +1 for 5c suit *if* it has an honor

- +1 for strong intermediates (10s and 9s), especially in long suit

- -1p for :shape:`4-3-3-3`

- -1p for dubious doubleton (:suit:`KQ` :suit:`KJ` :suit:`QJ`)

- -1p for Ace-less hand

- -1p if much of the strength is in short suits


**Balanced shapes**: :shape:`5-3-3-2`, :shape:`4-4-3-2`, :shape:`4-3-3-3`, always open these as NT.

**Semi-balanced shapes**:  :shape:`5-4-2-2` and :shape:`6-3-2-2`. Generally, not ok for NT,
but use judgement: if the short suits have stoppers, these might be ok.


NT ranges
=========

.. hlist::

  - 12-14p: 1 suit, plan jump to `1NT`
  - 15-17p: `1NT**`
  - 18-19p: 1 suit, plan jump to `2NT`
  - 20-21p: `2NT`
  - 22-24p: `2C` then `2NT`
  - 25-27p: `3NT`
  - 28-29p: `2C` then `3NT`
  - 30-31p: `2C` then `4NT`

.. topic:: Gambling `3NT*`

  A popular convention for hands with a long minor suit, replacing the standard `3NT` bid.
  It promises a suit like :suit:`AKQJxxx` (seven cards) or :suit:`AKQxxxxx+` (eight or more).
  There should be little power in the side suits (otherwise, a slam could be missed).

  .. compound:: **Responses:**

    - `p` if responder can make 2 tricks and has reasonable stoppers in other suits

    - `4C` to "pass or correct"; opener will correct to `4D` if that was their suit

    - `5C/6C/7C` work similarly with lots of strength in opener

    - `4H/4S` is natural, to play

  If this is used, use `2C-3NT` for 25-27p, and `2C-4NT` for 28-29p, and `4NT` for 30-31p.


1NT
===

`1NT**` needs to be announced; it should be "14-plus to 17", since it can
be shaded up to 15. Do not shade up from lower than 14p.

.. tip::

  - :hand:`A7 KT8 AJ9 QT962` — 14hcp +1p for 5c suit w/honor; open `1NT`

  - :hand:`KQx KJ T8532 AT3` — 14hcp but long suit is weak; open `1D`

  - :hand:`A4 AT9 AT872 KJ9` — borderline

  - :hand:`AT2 K93 QT842 KQ` — borderline

Responding
----------

.. hlist::
  :columns: 3

  - 0-7p: pass
  - 8-9p: invitational
  - 10-15p: game
  - 16-17p: slam invite
  - 18+p: slam

.. _stayman:

Stayman `1NT-2C`
----------------

- **Garbage Stayman**: for weak hands like :shape:`4=4=4=1`; pass whatever opener says

- Otherwise: invitational or better

  - Don't use for :shape:`4-3-3-3` hands; will make as many tricks in NT

- For 5c-4c majors, use Stayman & if they answer w/4, transfer to 5

- **Pretend Stayman**: 5c GF in minor - `1NT-2DHS-3m` (don't need to have 4 in a major)

  - For 6+c in minor, see :ref:`nt-long-minor`


.. _jacoby-transfers:

Jacoby transfers `1NT-2DHS**`
-----------------------------

Use for transferring to all 5+c majors (except 5c-4c, see :ref:`stayman`).

Must be announced, eg "transfer to Spades".

.. compound::

  Opener transfers, then responder responds:

  - 5c major: bid `2NT` (invite) or `3NT` (game); partner converts to major with 3

  - 6c major: bid `3M` (invite) or `4M` (game)

  - 5c-5c M hands

    - Invitational: xfer to `2H`, bid `2S`; tells partner you have 5c-5c and to pick |h|/|s|

    - GF: xfer to `2S` and bid `4H`; partner will know you have 5c-5c and can pick |h|/|s|

    - Slam interest: xfer to `2S` and rebid `3H`

.. rubric:: Other transfers

- `1NT-2S**` is transfer to `3C` (to play); partner can correct `3D` (to play)

- **Jacoby Super Accept**: 4c in major and max 1NT: `1NT-2D**-3H*` (*not* `2H`)


.. rst-class:: small

  **Note:** For people who don't use transfers, `2H/2S` would be signoff for weak transfers.


.. _texas:

Texas transfers `1NT-4DH*`
--------------------------

Use to show game values and 6c in a suit. **Not part of SAYC.**

.. compound::

  Examples:

  - `1NT-4D*-4H-p` if you aren't interested in slam

  - `1NT-4D*-4H-4NT` is ace-asking

  - With Texas:

    - `1NT-2D*-2H-4NT`: now quantitative, invites slam in either |h| (with 5c) or NT

    - `1NT-2D*-2H-4H`: now mild slam interest


.. _nt-long-minor:

Long minor: `1NT-3m*`
---------------------

Game invite with 6+c in minor.

- Good idea (but not in SAYC): requires 2 of 3 top honors

  - If opener has missing honor or :suit:`Jxx/Txx/xxxx`, they go to 3NT *(suit can be run)*

- If have 7+c and :suit:`AK`, just do `1NT-3NT`, very likely can be run


Long major: `1NT-3M`
--------------------

- 6+c, interest in slam (else would just transfer)

Other NT opening
================

If opener bids suit before NT (eg `1s-?s-1NT`), above systems are off.

For other NT openings (eg `2NT`, `2C-?s-2NT`), above systems are on.


All NT opening responses
========================

Gerber `?NT-4C`
---------------

Ace-asking for slams; see :ref:`gerber`.

Quantitative invites `?NT-4NT/5NT`
----------------------------------

- `?NT-4NT`:  see :ref:`4nt-quant`.

- `?NT-5NT`:  see :ref:`5nt-quant`.


Interference
============

- `1NT-(X)` is still systems-on

  - Can escape to `2C/2D` with redouble: `1NT-(X)-XX-(p)-2C`

- `1NT-(2C)-X` is Stayman

- `1NT-(?s)-?s` is systems-off and natural; `X` is for penalty

  - 3-level bids are GF: `1NT-(2S)-3H`

- Cue bid is GF and Stayman: `1NT-(2H)-3H` (shows 4+\ |s|)

.. rubric:: Interference with Stayman

- Stayman doubled `1NT-(2C)-X`

  - Make normal rebid
  - Pass w/4 weak clubs
  - Redouble w/5 clubs or 4 good clubs

- Stayman overcalled, like `1NT-2C-(2S)`

  - Bid 4c M at 2-level
  - `X` double for penalty (w/4c in opp suit)
  - Pass (responder then: `X` doubles for penalty, `p` passes, or makes normal bid)

.. rubric:: Interference with transfers

- Transfer doubled, like `1NT-2H-(X)`

  - `XX` redouble with strong holding in doubled suit (here, shows |h| strength not |s|)
  - Complete transfer `2S` (shows 3+t) or `3S` (4+t and max)
  - Pass (responder then: `p/XX` to play, normal bid, or sign off with `2M`)

- Transfer overcalled, like `1NT-2H-(2S)`

  - Bid `3M` w/good supporting hand
  - `X` double for penalty
  - Pass (responder then: re-transfer, normal bid, `X` double for strength, `p` pass)
